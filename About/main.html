Welcome! This is my personal website.

<br>

I am a computer science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

<br><br>

The primary purpose of this page is to host information about projects I
have done. Check out the projects tab or my <a href="https://www.github.com/andrewwellercs">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nEOxnE_cywMkimgEyDyLQ">Youtube</a> for more info!

This is a static webpage compiled using my own webpage generating bash script! Ask me about my experience with linux!
