"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to year for the vast and endless sea."

Welcome! This is my personal website.

<br>

I am a computer science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

<br><br>

The primary purpose of this page is to host information about projects I
have done. Check out the projects tab or my <a href="https://www.github.com/andrewwellercs">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nEOxnE_cywMkimgEyDyLQ">Youtube</a> for more info!

<br><br>

This is a static webpage compiled using my own webpage generating bash script! Ask me about my experience with linux!

<br><br>

Feel free to shoot me an email if you come across my site! I would love to test out my mail server with different people.
